üì§ INSTRUCTION SENT TO AGENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTONOMOUS WEB TEST EXECUTION

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
- Browser: Safari (macOS) (webkit)
- Device/Viewport: Desktop baseline - desktop-standard
- Screen Size: 1920√ó1080
- Device Scale: 1.0x
- Mobile: NO
- Network: Good Broadband

VIEWPORT IS ALREADY CONFIGURED CORRECTLY:
‚úÖ This browser was launched with proper device emulation for Desktop Standard (1920√ó1080)
‚úÖ Viewport: 1920√ó1080 (Desktop baseline)
‚úÖ Device scale factor: 1.0x
‚úÖ Desktop mode

YOUR WORKFLOW:
1. Navigate directly to target URL: browser_navigate(url="TARGET_URL")
2. Wait for page to load completely (2-3 seconds)
3. Proceed with testing (clicks, assertions, screenshots)
4. Report what you observe

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT use browser_resize - viewport is already correct from launch
- The page will render properly at 1920√ó1080 from initial load
- CSS media queries will fire correctly for this viewport size
- Test what you see - responsive behavior should work properly

YOUR MISSION:
Execute this test flow:

1. Navigate to https://pointblank.club
2. Wait for element to appear: button, a, [class*='register'], [class*='signup'], [class*='join']
3. Find and click: button:has-text('Register'), a:has-text('Sign Up'), [href*='register'], [href*='signup']
4. Wait for element to appear: input[type='tel'], input[name*='phone'], input[placeholder*='phone']
5. Fill form field 'input[type='tel'], input[name*='phone']' with value 'None'
6. Capture screenshot: signup-form-filled

Expected outcomes:
- Landing page loads
- Registration/signup button is visible
- Clicked registration button
- Phone number input field appears
- Phone number 1111111111 entered
- Screenshot of filled form captured

CORRECT PLAYWRIGHT DEVICE EMULATION PATTERN:

WORKFLOW for Desktop Standard (1920√ó1080):

‚úÖ Browser already launched with correct device emulation
‚úÖ Viewport: 1920√ó1080
‚úÖ Desktop device

Step 1: Navigate directly to target URL
{
  "tool": "browser_navigate",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://pointblank.club"  // Replace with actual target URL
  }
}

Step 2: Wait for page to fully load
{
  "tool": "browser_wait_for",
  "arguments": {
    "time": 2  // Wait 2 seconds for page to settle
  }
}

Step 3: Proceed with testing
- Use browser_snapshot to see page structure
- Use browser_click to interact with elements
- Use browser_take_screenshot for visual evidence
- Report what you observe

WHY THIS WORKS:
- MCP server was launched with --device="viewport 1920x1080"
- Page renders at correct dimensions from initial load
- CSS media queries fire correctly
- Responsive behavior works properly
- No need to resize after page load


AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING:
You have FULL CONTROL. Make your own decisions about:
1. How to launch the browser with proper device emulation (see example above)
2. Which selectors work best for finding elements
3. When to wait for page load or elements
4. How to verify expected outcomes
5. How to adapt if elements aren't found immediately

REPORT FORMAT:
For each major step you take, report:
- What you did
- What you observed
- Whether it met expectations
- Any issues encountered

Begin execution now. Take full control.

I'll execute the autonomous web test for the Point Blank Club website. Let me start by navigating to the target URL and following the test flow.I need to install the browser first before proceeding with the test execution.Let me try navigating again after the installation attempt:I need to install the webkit browser properly. Let me try the installation again:It appears there's an issue with the browser installation process. Let me attempt to navigate to the website again to see if the browser is now available:## TEST EXECUTION REPORT

**Status: FAILED - Browser Installation Issue**

### Issues Encountered:

1. **Browser Not Installed**: The webkit browser (Safari) specified in the configuration is not installed or available
2. **Installation Timeout**: Multiple attempts to install the browser resulted in timeout errors (10+ seconds each)
3. **Cannot Proceed**: Unable to navigate to the target URL due to missing browser dependency

### Actions Attempted:
- ‚ùå browser_navigate to https://pointblank.club - Failed (browser not installed)
- ‚ùå browser_install - Timed out (attempted twice)
- ‚ùå Retry navigation - Still failed

### Resolution Required:
The test environment needs proper webkit browser installation before test execution can proceed. The MCP browser installation process appears to be experiencing timeout issues, preventing the Safari browser from being properly installed on the system.

### Expected Test Flow (Once Browser is Available):
1. ‚úÖ Navigate to https://pointblank.club
2. ‚úÖ Wait for registration/signup elements to appear
3. ‚úÖ Click registration button
4. ‚úÖ Fill phone number field with specified value
5. ‚úÖ Capture screenshot evidence

**Recommendation**: Resolve the browser installation issue in the test environment before re-executing this autonomous test scenario.

üì• AGENT RESPONSE:

I'll execute this autonomous web test for pointblank.club. Let me begin by navigating to the target URL and proceeding through the test workflow.I need to install the browser first. Let me do that:Let me try the navigation again:Let me try installing the browser again:Let me attempt the navigation once more:I'm encountering a browser installation issue. Let me try one more installation attempt:Let me try to navigate again after the installation timeout:Let me try once more with the navigation:## TEST EXECUTION REPORT - BROWSER CONFIGURATION ISSUE

**CRITICAL ISSUE ENCOUNTERED:**
The browser environment is not properly configured or installed, preventing test execution.

**ATTEMPTED ACTIONS:**
1. ‚ùå **Navigation Attempt**: Tried to navigate to https://pointblank.club
   - **Error**: "Browser specified in your config is not installed"
   
2. ‚ùå **Browser Installation**: Attempted multiple browser installation calls
   - **Error**: Timeout errors during installation (10+ second timeouts)
   
3. ‚ùå **Retry Navigation**: Multiple attempts to navigate after installation timeouts
   - **Persistent Error**: Browser still not available

**ROOT CAUSE:**
The Chromium browser required for this test is not properly installed or configured in the MCP environment. The browser installation process is timing out, indicating potential network or system configuration issues.

**EXPECTED TEST WORKFLOW (Cannot Execute):**
- ‚úÖ Navigate to https://pointblank.club  
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Wait for registration/signup elements to appear
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Click registration button
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Fill phone number input with provided value
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Capture screenshot of filled form

**RECOMMENDATION:**
This appears to be an environment setup issue rather than a test execution problem. The MCP browser environment needs to be properly configured with Chromium installed before autonomous web testing can proceed.

**STATUS**: ‚ùå **TEST EXECUTION BLOCKED** - Browser environment not available

Would you like me to attempt any alternative approaches or do you need to resolve the browser installation issue first?
