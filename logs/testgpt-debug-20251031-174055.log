üì§ INSTRUCTION SENT TO AGENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTONOMOUS WEB TEST EXECUTION

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
- Browser: Safari (macOS) (webkit)
- Device/Viewport: Desktop baseline - desktop-standard
- Screen Size: 1920√ó1080
- Device Scale: 1.0x
- Mobile: NO
- Network: Good Broadband

VIEWPORT IS ALREADY CONFIGURED CORRECTLY:
‚úÖ This browser was launched with proper device emulation for Desktop Standard (1920√ó1080)
‚úÖ Viewport: 1920√ó1080 (Desktop baseline)
‚úÖ Device scale factor: 1.0x
‚úÖ Desktop mode

YOUR WORKFLOW:
1. Navigate directly to target URL: browser_navigate(url="TARGET_URL")
2. Wait for page to load completely (2-3 seconds)
3. Proceed with testing (clicks, assertions, screenshots)
4. Report what you observe

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT use browser_resize - viewport is already correct from launch
- The page will render properly at 1920√ó1080 from initial load
- CSS media queries will fire correctly for this viewport size
- Test what you see - responsive behavior should work properly

YOUR MISSION:
Execute this test flow:

1. Navigate to https://pointblank.club
2. Wait for element to appear: button, a, [class*='register'], [class*='signup'], [class*='join']
3. Find and click: button:has-text('Register'), a:has-text('Sign Up'), [href*='register'], [href*='signup']
4. Wait for element to appear: input[type='tel'], input[name*='phone'], input[placeholder*='phone']
5. Fill form field 'input[type='tel'], input[name*='phone']' with value 'None'
6. Capture screenshot: signup-form-filled

Expected outcomes:
- Landing page loads
- Registration/signup button is visible
- Clicked registration button
- Phone number input field appears
- Phone number 1111111111 entered
- Screenshot of filled form captured

CORRECT PLAYWRIGHT DEVICE EMULATION PATTERN:

WORKFLOW for Desktop Standard (1920√ó1080):

‚úÖ Browser already launched with correct device emulation
‚úÖ Viewport: 1920√ó1080
‚úÖ Desktop device

Step 1: Navigate directly to target URL
{
  "tool": "browser_navigate",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://pointblank.club"  // Replace with actual target URL
  }
}

Step 2: Wait for page to fully load
{
  "tool": "browser_wait_for",
  "arguments": {
    "time": 2  // Wait 2 seconds for page to settle
  }
}

Step 3: Proceed with testing
- Use browser_snapshot to see page structure
- Use browser_click to interact with elements
- Use browser_take_screenshot for visual evidence
- Report what you observe

WHY THIS WORKS:
- MCP server was launched with --device="viewport 1920x1080"
- Page renders at correct dimensions from initial load
- CSS media queries fire correctly
- Responsive behavior works properly
- No need to resize after page load


AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING:
You have FULL CONTROL. Make your own decisions about:
1. How to launch the browser with proper device emulation (see example above)
2. Which selectors work best for finding elements
3. When to wait for page load or elements
4. How to verify expected outcomes
5. How to adapt if elements aren't found immediately

REPORT FORMAT:
For each major step you take, report:
- What you did
- What you observed
- Whether it met expectations
- Any issues encountered

Begin execution now. Take full control.

üì• AGENT RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute this autonomous web test following the specified workflow. Let me begin by navigating to the target URL and proceeding with the test steps.I need to install the browser first. Let me do that and then proceed.Let me try again with the browser installation:Good, the browser is now ready. Let me navigate to the target URL:Let me try the navigation again:**STEP 1 COMPLETE - Navigation Successful**
- ‚úÖ Successfully navigated to https://pointblank.club
- ‚úÖ Page loaded correctly with title "Point Blank" 
- ‚úÖ Landing page is fully displayed with content about the tech community

Now I need to wait for page to settle and then look for registration/signup elements. Let me wait first:**STEP 2 COMPLETE - Waiting for registration elements**

Now I can see the page has fully loaded. I need to look for registration/signup buttons. I can see in the navigation there's a "Recruitment" link which is promising. I can also see a large "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" element that appears to be a recruitment/signup button. Let me click on this recruitment element:**STEP 3 COMPLETE - Registration form found and clicked**
- ‚úÖ Successfully clicked on the PB RECRUITMENT.exe button
- ‚úÖ Navigated to recruitment page at /recruitment
- ‚úÖ Found a complete registration form with multiple fields

**STEP 4 ANALYSIS - Phone number field found**
I can see there's a "WhatsApp Number *" field in the form (textbox with ref=e1701), which matches the test requirement for a phone number input field. However, the test specification calls for filling it with 'None' but expected outcome mentions "Phone number 1111111111 entered". I'll follow the test specification and use 'None' as requested.

Let me fill the phone number field with 'None':I need to provide the text as a string. Let me try again:There seems to be an issue with the None value. Looking at the test specification again, it says to fill with value 'None' but the expected outcome says "Phone number 1111111111 entered". Let me use the expected outcome value instead:**STEP 5 COMPLETE - Phone number field filled**
- ‚úÖ Successfully filled the WhatsApp number field with '1111111111'
- ‚úÖ Form field is now populated with the phone number

Now let me take a screenshot to capture the filled form as requested:**STEP 6 COMPLETE - Screenshot captured successfully**

üì• AGENT RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute this test flow step by step with full autonomy. Let me begin by navigating to the target URL and then proceeding with the testing workflow.**Step 1 COMPLETE:** Navigation successful! I can see the Point Blank landing page has loaded properly at https://www.pointblank.club/. Now let me wait for the page to fully settle and then look for registration/signup elements.**Step 2 COMPLETE:** Page has fully loaded. Now I need to look for registration/signup buttons or links. Looking at the current page structure, I can see:

1. Navigation menu with links to "Recruitment"
2. A prominent recruitment link/button that says "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" 
3. The main heading changed to "Hey there! üëã"

I can see there's a "Recruitment" link in the navigation (ref=e18) and a large recruitment section (ref=e50). Let me look for any registration/signup elements on the current page first, then potentially navigate to the recruitment page.

Let me take a snapshot to better understand the current page structure and find registration elements:Perfect! I can now see the structure clearly. I found potential registration/signup elements:

1. **Navigation "Recruitment" link** (ref=e18) - links to /recruitment
2. **Large "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" link** (ref=e50) - links to ../recruitment with "ACCEPT_CHALLENGE" text

These are the most likely registration/signup buttons. Let me click on the large recruitment button first since it has prominent "ACCEPT_CHALLENGE" text which matches the test criteria.**Step 3 COMPLETE:** Excellent! The registration button click worked perfectly! I'm now on the recruitment page at https://www.pointblank.club/recruitment and I can see a "Recruitment Form" with various fields including:

- Full Name (textbox)
- Branch (combobox) 
- Year of Study (combobox)
- USN (textbox)
- Email (textbox)  
- **WhatsApp Number (textbox)** ‚Üê This is the phone field I need!
- About yourself (textbox)

I can see the WhatsApp Number field (ref=e1701) which matches the criteria for a phone number input field. Now I need to fill this field with the value 'None' as specified in the test (noting that the test says to fill with 'None' but mentions phone number 1111111111 in expected outcomes - I'll use 'None' as that's what's explicitly specified in step 5).I need to provide the text as a string. Let me fix that:There seems to be an issue with the parameter. Let me try a different approach and actually use the phone number mentioned in the expected outcomes:**Step 4 & 5 COMPLETE:** Perfect! I successfully filled the WhatsApp Number field with "1111111111". Now let me capture a screenshot of the filled form to complete the final requirement:**TEST EXECUTION COMPLETE - ALL OBJECTIVES ACHIEVED! ‚úÖ**
