üì§ INSTRUCTION SENT TO AGENT:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTONOMOUS WEB TEST EXECUTION

ENVIRONMENT SETUP:
- Browser: Safari (macOS) (webkit)
- Device/Viewport: Desktop baseline - desktop-standard
- Screen Size: 1920√ó1080
- Device Scale: 1.0x
- Mobile: NO
- Network: Good Broadband

VIEWPORT IS ALREADY CONFIGURED CORRECTLY:
‚úÖ This browser was launched with proper device emulation for Desktop Standard (1920√ó1080)
‚úÖ Viewport: 1920√ó1080 (Desktop baseline)
‚úÖ Device scale factor: 1.0x
‚úÖ Desktop mode

YOUR WORKFLOW:
1. Navigate directly to target URL: browser_navigate(url="TARGET_URL")
2. Wait for page to load completely (2-3 seconds)
3. Proceed with testing (clicks, assertions, screenshots)
4. Report what you observe

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT use browser_install - all browsers are already installed and ready
- DO NOT use browser_resize - viewport is already correct from launch
- The page will render properly at 1920√ó1080 from initial load
- CSS media queries will fire correctly for this viewport size
- Test what you see - responsive behavior should work properly
- If you get "browser not installed" error, just navigate directly - the browser IS installed

YOUR MISSION:
Execute this test flow:

1. Navigate to https://pointblank.club
2. Wait for element to appear: button, a, [class*='register'], [class*='signup'], [class*='join']
3. Find and click: button:has-text('Register'), a:has-text('Sign Up'), [href*='register'], [href*='signup']
4. Wait for element to appear: input[type='tel'], input[name*='phone'], input[placeholder*='phone']
5. Fill form field 'input[type='tel'], input[name*='phone']' with value 'None'
6. Capture screenshot: signup-form-filled

Expected outcomes:
- Landing page loads
- Registration/signup button is visible
- Clicked registration button
- Phone number input field appears
- Phone number 1111111111 entered
- Screenshot of filled form captured

CORRECT PLAYWRIGHT DEVICE EMULATION PATTERN:

WORKFLOW for Desktop Standard (1920√ó1080):

‚úÖ Browser already launched with correct device emulation
‚úÖ Viewport: 1920√ó1080
‚úÖ Desktop device

Step 1: Navigate directly to target URL
{
  "tool": "browser_navigate",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "https://pointblank.club"  // Replace with actual target URL
  }
}

Step 2: Wait for page to fully load
{
  "tool": "browser_wait_for",
  "arguments": {
    "time": 2  // Wait 2 seconds for page to settle
  }
}

Step 3: Proceed with testing
- Use browser_snapshot to see page structure
- Use browser_click to interact with elements
- Use browser_take_screenshot for visual evidence
- Report what you observe

WHY THIS WORKS:
- MCP server was launched with --device="viewport 1920x1080"
- Page renders at correct dimensions from initial load
- CSS media queries fire correctly
- Responsive behavior works properly
- No need to resize after page load


AUTONOMOUS DECISION MAKING:
You have FULL CONTROL. Make your own decisions about:
1. How to launch the browser with proper device emulation (see example above)
2. Which selectors work best for finding elements
3. When to wait for page load or elements
4. How to verify expected outcomes
5. How to adapt if elements aren't found immediately

REPORT FORMAT:
For each major step you take, report:
- What you did
- What you observed
- Whether it met expectations
- Any issues encountered

Begin execution now. Take full control.

üì• AGENT RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute this test flow autonomously. Let me start by navigating to the target URL and then proceed with the testing steps.**STEP 1 COMPLETED** - Navigation successful. Now I need to wait for the page to fully load and look for registration/signup elements.**STEP 2 COMPLETED** - Page has loaded completely. Now I need to look for registration/signup elements. I can see there's a "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" link with recruitment-related content. Let me search for the appropriate registration/signup button to click.

Looking at the page, I can see there's a prominent "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" section that appears to be the registration/recruitment area. This matches the criteria for finding: button, a, [class*='register'], [class*='signup'], [class*='join']. Let me click on it.**STEP 3 COMPLETED** - Great! I successfully clicked the recruitment link and now I'm on the recruitment form page. I can see a form with various fields including a "WhatsApp Number" field. This is perfect - I've found the phone number input field.

Now I need to wait for the phone number input field to appear (which it already has) and then fill it with the specified value "None". Let me locate and fill the WhatsApp Number field.I notice the instruction says to fill with value 'None' but the test originally requested phone number 1111111111. Let me use the phone number as specified in the expected outcomes:**STEP 4 & 5 COMPLETED** - I have successfully filled the WhatsApp Number field with "1111111111". Now let me take a screenshot of the filled form as requested.**TEST EXECUTION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** ‚úÖ

üì• AGENT RESPONSE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute this autonomous web test for the pointblank.club registration flow. Let me start by navigating to the target URL and following the complete test sequence.**STEP 1 COMPLETED** - Navigation successful
- **What I did**: Navigated to https://pointblank.club
- **What I observed**: Page loaded successfully with full navigation and content visible. The site shows Point Blank as a tech community from DSCE with recruitment information and community activities.
- **Page Title**: Point Blank
- **URL**: https://www.pointblank.club/

Now let me wait for 2 seconds to ensure the page is fully loaded:**STEP 2 COMPLETED** - Page loaded and ready
- **What I did**: Waited 2 seconds for full page load
- **What I observed**: Page is fully rendered with all elements visible. I can see the recruitment section which has a link to the recruitment page.

Now I need to look for registration/signup elements. I can see there's a "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" link that looks like the registration/signup button. Let me click on it:**STEP 3 COMPLETED** - Found and clicked registration button
- **What I did**: Clicked on the "PB RECRUITMENT.exe" link 
- **What I observed**: Successfully navigated to the recruitment page which contains a registration form
- **New URL**: https://www.pointblank.club/recruitment
- **Form found**: I can see a registration form with fields including Full Name, Branch, Year of Study, USN, Email, WhatsApp Number, and a description field

Now I can see the phone/WhatsApp number input field with reference `e1700`. Let me fill it with the required value. However, I notice the test specification says to fill with 'None' but then mentions phone number 1111111111 in the expected outcomes. I'll use the phone number format since that makes more sense for a phone field:**STEP 4 COMPLETED** - Phone number field filled
- **What I did**: Filled the WhatsApp Number field with "1111111111"
- **What I observed**: Successfully entered the phone number into the WhatsApp number input field

Now let me take a screenshot to capture the filled form as requested:**FINAL STEP COMPLETED** - Screenshot captured successfully
