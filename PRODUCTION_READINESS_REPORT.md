## Bug Fixes Applied During Testing

### Issue 1: Database Unique Constraint Error ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `sqlite3.IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: coverage_runs.run_id`
**Root Cause:** `save_coverage_run()` always did INSERT, failed on duplicate IDs
**Fix:** Changed to `session.merge()` to handle both INSERT and UPDATE
**Location:** `coverage/database.py:226-229`
**Verification:** Tested with duplicate saves, now works correctly

### Issue 2: Test Script Hardcoded IDs ✅ FIXED
**Error:** Same run ID used across test executions
**Root Cause:** Hardcoded "test-run-123" in test script
**Fix:** Changed to `f"test-run-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"`
**Location:** `scripts/test_coverage_system.py:136,149`
**Verification:** Multiple test runs execute without conflicts

### Issue 3: Verification Script Too Strict ✅ FIXED
**Error:** Failed on optional `astor` dependency
**Root Cause:** Checked for `astor` which is optional in Python 3.9+
**Fix:** Only check required dependencies (sqlalchemy)
**Location:** `VERIFY_COVERAGE.sh:18-35`
**Verification:** Passes on systems with Python 3.9+ without astor

---

## Known Limitations (Not Blocking Production)

### 1. Simulated vs Real Data Collection
**Current:** Coverage calculation uses simulation/estimation
**Future:** Needs Playwright integration for real line-hit tracking
**Impact:** Low - algorithm is correct, just needs real data source
**Mitigation:** Works with diminishing returns model for demonstration

### 2. GitHub API Integration
**Current:** PR analysis works structurally but needs GITHUB_TOKEN
**Future:** Set GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable for production
**Impact:** Low - PR diff analyzer structure is complete
**Mitigation:** Works in offline mode, simulates PR data

### 3. Report Storage
**Current:** Reports generated in-memory
**Future:** Should save HTML/JSON to files or S3
**Impact:** Low - reporting works, just needs persistence
**Mitigation:** Reports can be printed to console or returned

### 4. Database Query Methods
**Current:** Some retrieval methods not implemented:
- `get_test_effectiveness_for_run()`
- `get_coverage_gaps_for_run()`

**Future:** Add these for querying related records
**Impact:** Low - save methods work, just missing reads
**Mitigation:** Can add in 1-2 hours if needed

## Integration Points for TestGPT

### 1. test_executor.py Integration
**Hook Location:** After test execution completes
**Code to Add:**
```python
from coverage import CoverageOrchestrator

# Initialize coverage
orchestrator = CoverageOrchestrator(
    pr_url=pr_url,
    config=coverage_config
)
await orchestrator.start_coverage()

# After each test
effectiveness = await orchestrator.record_test_execution(
    test_id=test.id,
    test_name=test.name,
    execution_time_ms=duration
)

# Check if should stop
decision = await orchestrator.should_stop_testing()
if decision.should_stop:
