## Technical Implementation Details

### Coverage Calculation Algorithm

```python
def _calculate_current_coverage(self) -> float:
    """
    Three-level fallback system:

    Level 1: Real coverage data (if available)
    - Calculates from actual line hits
    - Most accurate

    Level 2: Estimated from changed files (if PR analyzed)
    - Uses diminishing returns model
    - coverage_per_test = 15% initially
    - diminishing_factor = 0.85 per test
    - Converges to 100% asymptotically

    Level 3: Simple simulation (fallback)
    - Linear increase
    - 8% per test
    - Caps at 100%
    """
```

### Stop Condition Algorithm

```python
def _evaluate_stop_conditions(self, metrics) -> (bool, str, float):
    """
    Multi-criteria evaluation with priorities:

    Priority 1: Coverage + MCDC (confidence: 95%)
    Priority 2: Plateau detection (confidence: 85%)
    Priority 3: Time limit (confidence: 100%)
    Priority 4: Max tests (confidence: 90%)

    Returns: (should_stop, reason, confidence_score)
    """
```

### Gap Analysis

```python
async def _analyze_coverage_gaps(self) -> List[CoverageGap]:
    """
    Two-level gap identification:

    Level 1: Changed files
    - Identify uncovered files
    - Assign priority (critical if in critical paths)
    - Calculate risk score

    Level 2: Changed functions
    - Identify critical functions
    - Higher priority for auth/payment/security
    - Specific line ranges
    """
```
