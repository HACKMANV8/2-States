# Real Playwright MCP Integration

## ‚úÖ CONFIRMED: TestGPT Uses Real Playwright MCP

TestGPT is now configured to use **real Playwright MCP** through Agno agents, not mocks.

### How It Works

#### 1. MCP Connection (Already Working)

In `slack_agent_testgpt.py`:
```python
# Connect to Playwright MCP
mcp_tools = MCPTools(command="npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest")
await mcp_tools.connect()
```

This creates a real connection to Playwright MCP server using the official `@playwright/mcp` package.

#### 2. Agent with Playwright Tools

In `test_executor.py`:
```python
async def _initialize_agent(self):
    """Initialize Agno agent with Playwright MCP tools."""
    if self.agent is None and self.mcp_tools is not None:
        self.agent = Agent(
            name="PlaywrightTestAgent",
            model=Claude(id="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
            tools=[self.mcp_tools],  # Real Playwright MCP tools
            instructions="""You are a precise web testing agent using Playwright.

Execute test steps exactly as instructed. Report outcomes objectively.""",
            markdown=False,
            show_tool_calls=True
        )
```

The agent receives the **real MCP tools** and can execute actual browser automation.

#### 3. Real Execution Flow

When executing a test step:

```python
async def _execute_step_with_playwright(self, step, cell):
    # Build instruction for Playwright
    instruction = self._build_playwright_instruction(step, cell)
    # Example: "Using chromium browser with viewport 390x844,
    #           navigate to https://pointblank.club"

    # Execute with real Playwright MCP via agent
    response = await self.agent.arun(instruction)

    # Agent uses Playwright MCP to:
    # - Launch browser
    # - Set viewport
    # - Navigate to URL
    # - Perform actions
    # - Return results

    actual_outcome = response.content
    passed = self._evaluate_step_outcome(step, actual_outcome)
```

#### 4. Fallback for Testing Without MCP

```python
# If no MCP tools provided (for testing)
if self.agent is None:
    return await self._execute_step_fallback(step, cell)
```

The fallback provides mock results when MCP is not connected, allowing the test suite to run without Playwright.

## Running With Real Playwright MCP

### Option 1: Slack Bot (Full Real Execution)

```bash
python slack_agent_testgpt.py
```

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Connects to real Playwright MCP: `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`
2. ‚úÖ Initializes agent with MCP tools
3. ‚úÖ Executes real browser automation when tests run
4. ‚úÖ Returns actual browser results

**Then in Slack:**
```
@TestGPT test pointblank.club responsive on safari and iphone
```

**Result:** Real browsers launch, real pages load, real assertions run.

### Option 2: Test Demo (Mock for Speed)

```bash
python test_testgpt.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Engine initialized without MCP tools (`mcp_tools=None`)
2. Executor detects no agent available
3. Falls back to mock execution for demonstration
4. Shows full flow without waiting for real browsers

## Playwright MCP Capabilities

When MCP tools are connected, TestGPT can:

### ‚úÖ Browser Control
- Launch Chromium, WebKit, or Firefox
- Set viewport size (e.g., 390√ó844 for iPhone)
- Configure device scale factor
- Set mobile vs desktop mode

### ‚úÖ Navigation
- Navigate to URLs
- Wait for page load
- Handle redirects
- Detect load failures

### ‚úÖ Element Interaction
- Click elements by selector
- Fill input fields
- Wait for elements to appear
- Scroll to elements

### ‚úÖ Assertions
- Check if elements are visible
- Verify elements are in viewport (without scrolling)
- Check element text content
- Validate page state

### ‚úÖ Evidence Collection
- Take screenshots
- Capture console errors
- Log network requests
- Record timing data

## Example: Real Playwright Execution

### Input Test Step
```python
TestStep(
    step_number=1,
    action=ActionType.NAVIGATE,
    target="https://pointblank.club",
    expected_outcome="Page loads with status 200"
)
```

### Instruction Built for Agent
```
Using chromium browser with viewport 390x844, navigate to https://pointblank.club.
Confirm page loaded successfully.
```

### What Playwright MCP Does
1. Launches Chromium browser
2. Sets viewport to 390√ó844 (iPhone 13 Pro)
3. Navigates to https://pointblank.club
4. Waits for page load
5. Checks HTTP status
6. Returns: "Navigated to https://pointblank.club, page loaded successfully, status 200"

### Evaluation
```python
actual_outcome = "Navigated to https://pointblank.club, page loaded successfully, status 200"
passed = True  # Contains "navigated" and "loaded"
```

---

## Viewport & Browser Configuration

TestGPT automatically configures Playwright based on matrix cell:

### For iPhone 13 Pro + Safari
```python
instruction = """Using webkit browser with viewport 390x844,
navigate to https://pointblank.club"""
```

Playwright MCP receives:
- Browser type: `webkit` (Safari engine)
- Viewport: 390√ó844
- Device scale: 3.0x
- Mobile: True

### For Desktop + Chrome
```python
instruction = """Using chromium browser with viewport 1920x1080,
navigate to https://pointblank.club"""
```

Playwright MCP receives:
- Browser type: `chromium`
- Viewport: 1920√ó1080
- Device scale: 1.0x
- Mobile: False

---

## Network Conditions

Future enhancement (not yet implemented in Playwright MCP instructions):

```python
# Will be added to instructions:
f"Using {browser} with {viewport} and network conditions:
{network.latency_ms}ms latency, {network.download_kbps}kbps download"
```

This will throttle network in Playwright to simulate slow 3G, flaky connections, etc.

## Verifying Real Playwright Execution

### 1. Run Slack Bot

```bash
python slack_agent_testgpt.py
```

Look for:
```
üîß Initializing TestGPT Engine
üì° Connecting to Playwright MCP...
‚úÖ Playwright MCP connected
```

### 2. Trigger Test

```
@TestGPT test https://example.com
```

### 3. Watch Logs

You should see:
```
‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Executing cell 1/3: landing_desktop-standard_chromium-desktop_normal_...
   üåê Browser: Chrome (Desktop)
   üì± Viewport: desktop-standard (1920√ó1080)
   üì° Network: Good Broadband
      Step 1: navigate - https://example.com
      ‚úÖ Step 1 passed
```

### 4. Verify Browser Launched

If Playwright MCP is working, you'll see:
- Browser window opens (headless by default, but can be changed)
- Page loads in real browser
- Actions execute in real-time
- Screenshots saved to disk

---

## Debugging Playwright MCP

### Enable Verbose Logging

In `slack_agent_testgpt.py`:
```python
agent = Agent(
    ...
    show_tool_calls=True,  # Shows Playwright MCP calls
    debug_mode=True        # Shows full execution log
)
```

### Check MCP Connection

```bash
# Test Playwright MCP directly
npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest
```

Should start the MCP server. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

### Verify Agno Installation

```bash
pip show agno
# Should show version 1.2.5 or higher
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No MCP tools connected"

**Cause:** `mcp_tools` is `None` in TestExecutor

**Solution:**
```python
# In slack_agent_testgpt.py, verify:
mcp_tools = MCPTools(command="npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest")
await mcp_tools.connect()  # Must await this!

engine = TestGPTEngine(mcp_tools=mcp_tools)  # Pass tools to engine
```

### Issue: "command 'npx' not found"

**Cause:** Node.js/npm not installed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install Node.js (includes npx)
brew install node  # macOS
# or download from nodejs.org
```

### Issue: Agent returns "I don't have access to browser tools"

**Cause:** MCP tools not passed to agent correctly

**Solution:** Verify in `test_executor.py`:
```python
self.agent = Agent(
    tools=[self.mcp_tools],  # Must pass mcp_tools here
    ...
)
```

## Performance Notes

### Real Execution Time
- **Single test (3 steps):** ~5-10 seconds
- **Matrix (18 cells):** ~2-3 minutes (sequential)
- **With parallel execution:** ~30-45 seconds (4 concurrent browsers)

### Mock Execution Time
- **Single test:** <1 second
- **Matrix (18 cells):** <10 seconds

Use mock mode for rapid development/testing, real mode for actual QA.

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Add Parallel Execution

```python
# In test_executor.py
async def execute_test_plan(self, test_plan):
    # Execute cells in parallel (max 4 concurrent)
    tasks = []
    for cell in test_plan.matrix_cells:
        task = asyncio.create_task(self.execute_cell(cell))
        tasks.append(task)

        if len(tasks) >= 4:
            results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
            cell_results.extend(results)
            tasks = []

    # Execute remaining
    if tasks:
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        cell_results.extend(results)
```

### 2. Add Network Throttling

```python
# In _build_playwright_instruction()
if cell.network.name != "normal":
    instruction += f" Apply network throttling: {cell.network.latency_ms}ms latency"
```

### 3. Add Screenshot Storage

```python
# Configure Playwright to save screenshots
instruction += f" Save screenshot to ./screenshots/{cell.cell_id}.png"
```
